# WorkFlow
This was a group project where we were tasked to create a web app. 
We chose to create a student management app called 'WorkFlow'.
I focused on the front end devolpment using React/Material UI.
‘WorkFlow’ is a student management web-app that allows students to keep track of their schoolwork. Users can view their grades, assignments, timetable and deadlines.
